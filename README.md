Bike Sharing Assignment
Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.\
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands.

## Conclusions
**.** Positive coefficients indicates that rise in these values will lead to increment in the count of total numbers of rental bike(cnt).
        
**.** Wherein, Negative Coeffecients indicate that rise in these values will cause decrement in the count of total numbers of rental bike(cnt) .

**.** Temp is the most significant as it has the highest coefficient.

**.** count of total rental bikes is lesser on holidays.

**.**  Count of total rental bikes is higher in the month of September.
